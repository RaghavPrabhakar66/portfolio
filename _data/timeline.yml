  description: I have developed a pseudo LIDAR system utilizing cameras and advanced deep learning techniques,
               including DenseDepth, to achieve impressive 3D reconstruction from monocular images. Additionally,
               I've successfully created and trained a range of deep learning models for behavioral cloning
               in self-driving cars. This demonstrates my expertise in cutting-edge computer vision and autonomous
               vehicle technology.

  description: I have led the development and deployment of real-time object recognition models aimed at identifying
               buses, as well as OCR models designed to accurately read license plates. By seamlessly integrating these
               advanced models into the company's mobile application, I have enabled instantaneous bus detection and seat
               occupancy monitoring. Additionally, I took a proactive role in optimizing these models to ensure efficient 
               processing and minimal latency, resulting in an enhanced user experience.

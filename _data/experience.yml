    A pipeline was created to generate detailed top-down maps enriched with instance data, significantly improving the Visual 
    Language Navigation of an autonomous wheelchair. Additionally, a gesture-controlled robot was engineered to follow a person 
    while avoiding static obstacles, enhancing its navigation and interaction capabilities. These advancements have promising 
    applications in fields like healthcare and logistics.

    I helped develop an open-source, cross-platform Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) by using my expertise in 
    robotics and artificial intelligence. We made sure it worked with various hardware configurations and improved its reliability 
    and performance through careful data management. We also tested it extensively, especially in real-world scenarios using the 
    CARLA simulator framework. These efforts resulted in a strong and highly functional ADAS system.

    A real-time object recognition system has been developed and deployed, focusing on the detection of buses and the recognition 
    of their license plates using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models. These models have been seamlessly integrated into a 
    mobile application for real-time bus detection and seat occupancy monitoring. To ensure optimal performance, considerable 
    effort has been dedicated to model optimization, aiming for efficient processing and low latency. This integrated solution 
    significantly enhances bus tracking and occupancy management within the mobile app.

    A pseudo LIDAR system has been developed using cameras and deep learning techniques, utilizing DenseDepth for 3D reconstruction 
    from monocular images. Multiple deep learning models have also been developed and trained for behavioral cloning in self-driving
    cars, enabling them to emulate human driving behavior. In addition, lane detection algorithms have been integrated into these 
    systems, providing robust lane tracking and navigation capabilities. This holistic approach combines 3D scene understanding, 
    behavioral modeling, and lane detection to improve the performance and safety of autonomous vehicles.
